### **Motivation**   
I initially started this project because my father is a police officer. After the riots that happened in 2020, I felt like the public view on police was slandered. It was speculated that police in our city responded to groups of people differently based on certain characteristics. This project allowed me to dig into police coverage times in different demographic areas of the city, to see if there were truly differences among them. After viewing what my data told me on that topic, I decided to go further, and look at police incident coverage on a wider scale to see if any other patterns arose for the entire city.
